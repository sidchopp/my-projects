## My Projects

It is my "Portfolio website".

## What is it?

It has all the details about the projects, with their URL's - for you to see them in action, that I have worked on and deployed independently as well as with Agile teams, my detailed Resume - to know more about my work, my contact information - if you want to chat about some common interests we share, over a cup of coffee and some other information about me.
